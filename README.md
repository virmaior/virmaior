- 👋 Hi, I’m @virmaior
- 👀 I work at a university in Japan teaching classes and developing a proprietary LMS in PHP/MariaDB/Linux. In its current form, it has quite a bit of functionality not found in canvas, moodle, or blackboard. I'm working on bringing it to the point where I can release it more generally, but it's more of a personal project and distraction from my actual work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a bit of bash scripting to whip together some Wyze-related tools.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on intersting uses of Wyze cameras.
- 📫 How to reach me: that's a good question.
